# wirtual_external_auth (Data Source)

Use this data source to require users to authenticate with an external service prior to workspace creation. This can be used to [pre-authenticate external services](https://wirtual.dev/docs/admin/external-auth) in a workspace. (e.g. Google Cloud, Github, Docker, etc.)

## Example Usage

```terraform
provider "wirtual" {}


data "wirtual_external_auth" "github" {
  id = "github"
}

data "wirtual_external_auth" "azure-identity" {
  id       = "azure-identiy"
  optional = true
}
```

- `id` (String) The ID of a configured external auth provider set up in your Wirtual deployment.

### Optional

- `optional` (Boolean) Authenticating with the external auth provider is not required, and can be skipped by users when creating or updating workspaces

### Read-Only
